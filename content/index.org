Hi! I am Jyotirmoy Singh, a Pre-Final year student from [[https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/][Birla Institute of Technology And Science - Pilani]], double majoring in Economics (Master of Science, Hons.) and Computer Science & Engineering (Bachelor in Engineering).

I'm a builder at heart, I love working on novel ideas ground-up which got me into Research. I'm interested in solving complex and dynamic problems, especially the ones that can create a big impact for humanity!

Currently, I am working with [[https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/chittaranjanhota/][Professor Chittaranjan Hota]] on problems related to healthcare by building preventive methods for anomaly detection.

I will be joining *Google* as a *Software Engineering Intern* in the Summer of 2025.

I spent most of the summer of /'24/ discovering various interdisciplinary research domains, lying in core NLP, intersection of Life Sciences with CS, Computational Economics, and Ethics in AI.

I spent the summer of /'23/ as a *Research Intern* @ [[https://nesac.gov.in/][North Eastern Space Applications Centre]] with [[https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FRfH2igAAAAJ&hl=en][Scientist Ritu Anilkumar]] on building Neural Networks for Rainfall Prediction in North Eastern States of India.

In the past, I worked with [[https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/nlbhanu-murthy/][Professor N L Bhanu Murthy]] /(BITS Hyderabad)/ and [[https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/aruna-malapati/][Professor Aruna Malapati]] /(BITS Hyderabad)/ on building a small language model from scratch for a financial firm, as a part of a funded project with [[https://www.impactsure.com/][Impactsure Technologies]] [[https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/news/bits-pilani-and-impactsure-technologies-collaborate-for-pioneering-ai-research-101727855325506.html][(funded for 150,000+$)]].

I have a knack for problem solving and enjoy solving challenging questions from Project Euler in my free time, and have been a *National Level Gold Medalist in Mathematics*.

During the summer of /'23/, I also simultaneously worked on a startup for Content Marketing (few bits of which can be found [[https://foam-notebook-c6b.notion.site/Rich-Offer-Rich-Results-42052a57aab646f69a116e224d613193?pvs=74][here]]).

My passion for technology emerged early â€“ at 12, I launched my first startup in the eSports industry, and by 14, I had founded a competitive gaming league with a five-figure prize pool.
